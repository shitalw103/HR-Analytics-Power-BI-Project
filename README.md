<br>ðŸ›‘ Problem<br>
Organizations often face challenges such as:
<br>Lack of visibility into employee presence trends.
<br>Difficulty in tracking Work From Home (WFH%) vs Sick Leave (SL%) at scale.
<br>No clear insights on day-of-week patterns (e.g., lower presence on Fridays).
<br>Manual reporting leading to delayed decision-making.
<br>**âœ… Solution**<br>
I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides:
<br>Key metrics at a glance â€“ Presence%, WFH%, SL%.
<br>Trend analysis over time â€“ How presence, WFH, and SL% change monthly.
<br>Day-of-week analysis â€“ Identifying which weekdays have the highest/lowest presence.
<br>Employee-level details â€“ Presence and WFH% breakdown for each individual.
<br>Filters & interactivity â€“ Users can drill down by date range for quick insights.
