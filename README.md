ðŸ›‘ Problem
Organizations often face challenges such as:
Lack of visibility into employee presence trends.
Difficulty in tracking Work From Home (WFH%) vs Sick Leave (SL%) at scale.
No clear insights on day-of-week patterns (e.g., lower presence on Fridays).
Manual reporting leading to delayed decision-making.
âœ… Solution
I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides:
Key metrics at a glance â€“ Presence%, WFH%, SL%.
Trend analysis over time â€“ How presence, WFH, and SL% change monthly.
Day-of-week analysis â€“ Identifying which weekdays have the highest/lowest presence.
Employee-level details â€“ Presence and WFH% breakdown for each individual.
Filters & interactivity â€“ Users can drill down by date range for quick insights.
